This little program started out as a small project by one guy. 
It is also his first big-ish coding project on github.

You are welcome to contribute in any manner that seems appropriate 
and will puch the project forward, this can include features, 
bug fixes, git stuff and even advice.

Just be nice is the main thing :).
